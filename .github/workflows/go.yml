      - name: "hack - workaround github actions runner filesystem permission issue"
        # This hack should not be necessary, but if we don't do it, the
        # next step fails during docker build as docker does not have
        # permission to read files included in the github workspace that
        # were written by the previous step. This is pretty daft as we
        # don't even want or need docker to attempt to read these files
        # during the image build. Github actions appears to give us no way
        # to customise the build context to exclude it trying to read these
        # files.
